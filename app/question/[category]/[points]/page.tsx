      question: "What was your first impression of him, and was it accurate?",
      answer:
        "Sylvia and I first met purely in a work context. It was an intro meeting since I was the Eng Manager for the Messenger Growth team - the team where she was coming to do her second RPM rotation. \n\nI remember my first impression quite well. I remember being somewhere between incredulous and skeptical - since she was \"working\" remotely that week - either at EDC or ComiCon. She was curled up in some dark corner of the hotel, and I remember my initial thought was that there was no way that she was actually getting any real work done. Later on, I found out that I was indeed correct that this was a regular thing for her to work from a variety of destinations to squeeze more travel in while not dipping too much into time off. But I was incorrect in the assumption that she wasn't getting work done. I'm still not totally sure how she manages to get work done with all the travel she does.\n\nHer very first impression, though, I have less of a good sense. I have to imagine it was something like being direct and professional. I remember telling her about the engineers on the team and the engineer who was shifting into being the EM on that team. I do think that evolved over time, in a work context, where I came off as precise and exacting - having strong opinions - but also still supportive in trying to help people succeed and solve problems.",

      question: "What's one thing he did to try to impress you that totally failed?",
      answer:
        "So, the original intent wasn't to specifically impress Sylvia, but I still think this counts.\n\nThere was a Tuesday where we were on the Mission shuttle, heading to some bar as a group, with drinks in hand and just chatting as a group. We passed one of my favorite dive bars in the city - Clooney's.\n\nNow, for those who haven't been - Clooney's is a bonafide dive bar. Closes at 2am, opens back up at 6am for people who work the graveyard shift. They have a pool table and a jukebox. You saddle up to a horseshoe bar and the bartenders will play Liar's Dice with you. And on multiple occasions, I've seen the bartender need to break up a few fights. It also helped that I lived only a couple blocks away from it, so it was incredibly easy to get to, and for a while, it tended to be the 2nd location when we wanted to continue a Tuesday Night.\n\nSo I mention that this is my favorite dive bar, and Sylvia responds that if it's my favorite, then it must be good. So we set a plan to go to Clooney's at some point.\n\nThis is where our perspectives diverge.\n\nFor me - we set a plan for a different weekday and head to this dive bar. There wasn't romantic intent at the time - a first date at a dive bar would be quite a shot to take. It was a comfortable place to get simple drinks with activities like dice and pool to keep us busy as we chatted. I also wasn't a stranger to going to bars with people and just chatting.\n\nFor Sylvia - she turns up at the bar, and after 10-15 minutes asks me when other people were turning up. I told her I didn't invite anyone. She immediately became skeptical and I assume she thought I was trying to back-door a first date. So now she's stuck with some coworker that she wasn't interested in, at the time, at some divebar where she doesn't really drink (a fact I didn't realize at the time). So I'm certain she went from being excited for the night to starting to plan exit options. If I had been trying to impress her, this wasn't the way to do it.\n\nBut, there is charm to Clooney's. We got a few rounds. Played some pool and Liar's Dice. And just talked for a couple of hours. I think most importantly - we talked about things other than work. Which I later found out is a big thing for her - and she has typically found that not to be an attribute from most of the other engineers she knew.\n\nAnd so while it wasn't something I intentionally did to impress her, I think I obviously did something that failed spectacularly, but then somehow managed to salvage it by having the night be just getting to know each other on a personal level - without other ulterior motives.",

      question: 'If you had met in high school, would you have dated him or put him in the "friend zone"?',
      answer:
        "If you ask her, she would probably say she would have dated me.\n\nIf you ask me? I absolutely would have dated her.\n\nIn fact, I definitely joke that she would have been the what I would have described as my perfect girl in Highschool. Attractive, Smart, a Cheerleader, and Super Nerdy. It was a combo that I didn't really think existed. High school me would have thought he hit the jackpot (and present me still does feel that way).\nBut her, on the other hand?\nI was still finding myself in high school. I was a very quiet kid up through middle school. Then I switched schools for high school and started trying on a new personality. I was much louder, a lot more boisterous‚Äîwhich isn't inherently bad. But it was also less refined than it is now.\n\nSylvia appreciates some of those qualities - but in much more balance. And back then I didn't have a ton of it.\n\nShe also likes people with a broad, diverse set of interests. That wasn't me back then. I was pretty nerdy, liked video games, and listened to some music‚Äîbut I didn't have many other notable hobbies.\n\nSo, I think I'm lucky that we met when we did‚Äîbecause I had time to mature, even out, and grow into the person I am now.",

      question: "What's his most endearing yet slightly annoying habit?",
      answer:
        "If the question were reversed, I'd have an immediate answer‚ÄîSylvia's most endearing yet slightly annoying habit is her need to talk during TV and movies.\n\nMy favorite version of it ends up being: Sylvia expresses some theory she has, but then misses portions of the dialog or action as she's doing so. And then she asked me what just happened, even though I was listening to what she had to say and also missed whatever plot point is going on.\n\nDefinitely annoying. But also‚Ä¶ kind of endearing.\n\nFor if it's about me, I think it's a tie between two. Sylvia hates that I don't let people eat in my car. Eating during road trips, I've come to learn, is in, like, her top 5 favorite things to do. The other most endearing yet slightly annoying habit has been my commitment to going out for drinks on Tuesday nights.\n\nIt's annoying because it takes away a night of the week for planning things together. There have been pop-ups, concerts, events that Sylvia wanted to go to that I had to miss because they were on a Tuesday. Though, it rarely stops her from doing it. I remember finding out that she was watching a ton of movies in theaters, but I never knew because she was always back before I was! But I also think she finds it endearing because part of what she loves about me is my loyalty to my friend group and my tenacity in keeping up these connections.\n\nAnd finally, If you're looking for my habit that annoys her most - but that she doesn't find endearing - it's my struggle to keep up with the rate of messages she sends me on Instagram. There's so much good content there - but I open it way less frequently than she does - so I end up missing most things.",

        "This is an incredibly easy one. In my office, there's a box. It's something that I paid $500 for. It's from The Boring Company. It's a Flamethrower. Well, really, due to states taking issue with a company shipping flamethrowers across the US - it was renamed to be a Not A Flamethrower.\n\nI think it baffles her even more because I have never used it. It just sits there, in the packaging, collecting dust.\n\nIt also doesn't help that it's an Elon Musk product - but in my defense, I got it when he was a weirdo who wanted to make the world generally better compared to whatever he's doing now‚Ä¶",

      question: "What's the one thing you do that instantly makes him laugh?",
      answer:
        "So, my goal with Sylvia is not just to make her laugh, but it's to get a real reaction from her based on what I say. A scrunched up face, a groan, or my favorite - an eye roll when I tell an especially terrible joke. I'm convinced that she finds it endlessly amusing when I make awful, dad-level jokes, even though she doesn't express it as laughter‚Ä¶\n\nBut I think what really gets her to laugh is when I do something goofy. She sees me as a very serious person, and I don't do goofy things that often. Over time, she's rubbed off on me, and I do more goofy things than I used to - which always gets a chuckle out of her.",

      question: "Who will be the first to break a household rule, and what will it be?",
      answer:
        "We're a pretty rules-light household.\n\nBut if I had to pick‚Ä¶ I think we'd both break different rules:\nSylvia is the one who - when we're trying to eat healthy - is most likely to bring back sweets, pastries, and delicious things.\nMe? I am the one most likely to finish them all.\n\nThis probably shows up most when she comes back home with pints of ice cream. Sylvia has this habit where she'll take a single spoonful of ice cream, then leave the pint in the freezer for weeks. Meanwhile, I will eventually notice we have ice cream in the freezer and proceed to eat all but a spoonful or two.\n\nI could just finish the pint and throw it away. But I learned about an unspoken household rule that I will never again break. Early on in the pandemic, when we were sharing a dessert, I took the last bite. Sylvia was a mix of crest-fallen and furious.\n\nSo now I always leave one last bite for her‚Ä¶ Even if it means she gets mad at me for finishing the whole thing except a spoonful.\n\nThere is, also, a household rule, that I know Sylvia intends to break at some point. It's my no-eating-in-the-car rule. Of which she has stated in no uncertain terms that she does not intend to follow it when she's pregnant.",

I fully agree with expanding our children's horizons.\n\nBut I also know that I am more likely to be the parent who gives them a pass if they want to skip a lesson or play hooky for a day.\n\nI feel like sometimes, kids need a little space to decompress, and I think I'll be more inclined to allow that than Sylvia will.",

It's important to me that we eat together as a family.``\n\nThat always stuck with me.\n\nSo, the tradition I want?\n\nA simple one: spending dinners together‚Äîas often as we can, as a whole family.\n\nSitting down, talking about our days, spending time together."
